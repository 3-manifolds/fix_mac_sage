Fixing SageMath on macOS
========================

This small module is to help folks install and use SnapPy inside
SageMath, by doing two things:

1) Provide SSL support via openssl so that ``sage -pip install
   snappy`` works.

2) Install a recent version of Tk so that the SnapPy's graphics work
   in Sage.

Assuming you are using Sage 9.2 installed in
``/Applications/SageMath`` and downloaded this package into
``~/Downloads``, do::

  cd ~/Downloads
  sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine fix_mac_sage9_2.tgz
  tar xf fix_mac_sage9_2.tgz
  /Applications/SageMath/sage -python -m fix_mac_sage9_2.fix
